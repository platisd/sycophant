## What

`sycophant` is a tool that generates articles based on the latest news, utilizing OpenAI's APIs,
for text completion and image generation.
Sycophants in ancient Greece were slanderers, revealing petty crimes such as stealing figs.
In English, the word has come to mean a person who tells others what they want to hear, to gain some advantage.<br>
`sycophant` will generate an article based on the latest news, on the subject of your choosing.
However, since you are in control of the exact prompt that will be used for the generation,
it may be telling you what you want to hear. Does it have an advantage to gain? You decide. üòè

## Why

To be honest, `sycophant` is more of a gimmick at this point, or at least that's how I am personallyusing it.<br>
As the proud owner of the domain name [robots.army](https://robots.army/), I always wanted to have some sort of
news aggregator on the theme of robots.
At first I started with the [@RobotsArmy](https://twitter.com/RobotsArmy) Twitter bot, but it got banned. ü§£<br>
Now that OpenAI have opened up so many possibilities, what better way to create a fully autonomous news aggregator,
that generates its own, relatively authentic, content?

## How

`sycophant` is a [Python script](sycophant.py) that does the following:
1. Fetches the latest news on a subject, using the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) (free tier)
   * The user selects the subject and how old the news should be
1. Summarizes the top news, using OpenAI's [completion](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) API
   * The user selects how many articles to summmarize, the model to use, the prompt and the temperature
1. Generates an article based on the summaries, using OpenAI's [completion](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) API
   * The user selects the prompt
1. Generates tags for the article, using OpenAI's [completion](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) API
1. Generates a prompt, based on the article, to be used for image generation, using OpenAI's [completion](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) API
   * The user selects the prompt to generate... the prompt
1. Generates an image based on the prompt, using OpenAI's [image](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images) API
1. Creates a markdown file with the article, the image and the tags
   * The user provides a [Jinja](https://realpython.com/primer-on-jinja-templating/) template for the markdown file

`sycophant` assumes [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is used for static site generation.
You can see an example of a website automatically generated by `sycophant` at [platisd/robots.army](https://github.com/platisd/robots.army).

## Get started

The most difficult part of starting to use `sycophant` is -surprise, surprise- figuring out the optimum prompts.
That and possibly making some adjustments to the script if you use a different setup than the one described above.
Your best bet is to get inspired from [platisd/robots.army](https://github.com/platisd/robots.army) but, nonetheless,
let's go over the different things you would need to do.
